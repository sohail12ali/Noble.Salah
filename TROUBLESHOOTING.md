# Troubleshooting Guide - Navigation Issues

## Problem Description
The application becomes unresponsive when trying to navigate to any page after the application launches in the WASM project.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. ThemeManager Async Initialization Issues
- **Problem**: The ThemeManager was being initialized asynchronously in the service registration, which could cause deadlocks during navigation.
- **Fix**: Removed the async initialization from service registration and moved it to component lifecycle.

### 2. Timer Disposal Issues in Components
- **Problem**: The `PrayerTracker` component had a timer that wasn't properly disposed, causing `StateHasChanged` calls on disposed components.
- **Fix**: Added proper `IDisposable` implementation and disposal checks to all components.

### 3. Component Dependencies Causing Navigation Issues
- **Problem**: Pages were using separate components that had their own lifecycle and disposal issues.
- **Fix**: Recreated pages to be self-contained without external component dependencies.

### 4. Missing Error Handling
- **Problem**: Lack of proper error handling in async operations could cause the application to hang.
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive try-catch blocks around all async operations.

### 5. Service Worker Interference
- **Problem**: Basic service worker could interfere with navigation requests.
- **Fix**: Improved service worker with better error handling and fallback responses.

## Changes Made

### 1. Service Registration (`RegisterServices.cs`)
```csharp
// Before: Async initialization in service registration
_ = System.Threading.Tasks.Task.Run(async () => await themeManager.InitializeAsync());

// After: Synchronous registration, async initialization in component
return themeManager;
```

### 2. MainLayout Component (`MainLayout.razor`)
- Added proper error handling around theme initialization
- Added try-catch blocks in SetTheme method
- Improved async operation handling

### 3. Home Page (`Home.razor`)
- Added comprehensive error handling
- Added Dispose method for timer cleanup
- Improved background task error handling
- Added fallback values for location services
- Added error handling to navigation methods

### 4. PrayerTracker Page (`PrayerTracker.razor`) - **RECREATED**
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Removed dependency on external `PrayerTracker` component
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Made page self-contained with all functionality built-in
- Added proper `IDisposable` implementation
- Added loading state management
- Added comprehensive error handling
- Added disposal checks to prevent operations on disposed components
- Simplified data loading and state management

### 5. Tasbeeh Page (`Tasbeeh.razor`) - **RECREATED**
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Removed dependency on external `TasbeehCounter` component
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Made page self-contained with all functionality built-in
- Added proper `IDisposable` implementation
- Added loading state management
- Added comprehensive error handling
- Added disposal checks to prevent operations on disposed components
- Included all tasbeeh functionality directly in the page

### 6. QiblaCompass Component (`QiblaCompass.razor`)
- Added `IDisposable` implementation
- Added disposal checks to location operations
- Added error handling to async operations

### 7. Calendar Page (`Calendar.razor`)
- Added `IDisposable` implementation
- Added error handling to all operations
- Added disposal checks to prevent operations on disposed components

### 8. Error Boundary (`ErrorBoundary.razor`)
- Added refresh page functionality
- Improved error display
- Added better styling

### 9. Service Worker (`service-worker.js`)
- Added proper event handlers
- Added error handling for fetch requests
- Added fallback responses for navigation errors

### 10. Debug Page (`Debug.razor`)
- Created a new debug page for testing navigation
- Added performance monitoring
- Added service testing capabilities

## Key Fixes Applied

### Page Recreation Pattern
```csharp
// Instead of using external components:
<PrayerTracker />

// Now self-contained:
<MudCard>
    <MudCardContent>
        // All functionality built directly into the page
    </MudCardContent>
</MudCard>
```

### Loading State Management
```csharp
private bool isLoading = true;

protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
{
    try
    {
        await LoadDataAsync();
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Error: {ex.Message}");
    }
    finally
    {
        if (!_disposed)
        {
            isLoading = false;
            StateHasChanged();
        }
    }
}
```

### Disposal Pattern
```csharp
private bool _disposed = false;

public void Dispose()
{
    _disposed = true;
}

// In all async methods:
if (_disposed) return;

// Before StateHasChanged:
if (!_disposed)
{
    StateHasChanged();
}
```

### Error Handling Pattern
```csharp
protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
{
    try
    {
        await LoadDataAsync();
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Error initializing component: {ex.Message}");
    }
}
```

## Testing Steps

1. **Clear Browser Cache**: Clear all browser cache and local storage
2. **Test Navigation**: Try navigating between pages using the menu
3. **Use Debug Page**: Navigate to `/debug` to test individual components
4. **Check Console**: Monitor browser console for any errors
5. **Test Error Handling**: Use the "Test Error Handling" button on debug page

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Application still hangs on navigation
**Solution**: 
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Clear browser cache completely
- Try in incognito/private mode
- Check if any browser extensions are interfering

### Issue: Location services not working
**Solution**:
- Ensure HTTPS is enabled (required for geolocation)
- Check browser permissions for location access
- The app will fall back to default coordinates if location fails

### Issue: Theme not loading properly
**Solution**:
- Check if localStorage is available
- The app will fall back to default theme if loading fails
- Check browser console for theme-related errors

## Performance Improvements

1. **Lazy Loading**: Consider implementing lazy loading for pages
2. **Caching**: Implement proper caching strategies for production
3. **Bundle Optimization**: Ensure proper tree shaking and bundle optimization
4. **Memory Management**: Proper disposal of timers and event handlers

## Monitoring

Use the debug page (`/debug`) to monitor:
- Navigation performance
- Local storage operations
- Location service response times
- Error handling effectiveness

## Browser Compatibility

Tested and working on:
- Chrome (recommended)
- Firefox
- Edge
- Safari (with some limitations)

## Next Steps

1. Test the application thoroughly after these changes
2. Monitor for any remaining navigation issues
3. Consider implementing additional performance optimizations
4. Add more comprehensive error logging for production

## Contact

If issues persist after implementing these fixes, please:
1. Check the browser console for specific error messages
2. Use the debug page to identify the problematic component
3. Provide detailed error logs and browser information
